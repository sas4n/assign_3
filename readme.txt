To run the server in bash shell a user needs to change direction to the "server" folder first
A user could insert his/her Mysql's username and password when starting the server by using this command: "USER=[your username] PASSWORD=[your password] node app" (this command works on bash)
to run the client a user could double click on the index.html file or install Live server extension in Visual Studio code and run the HTML file there.
